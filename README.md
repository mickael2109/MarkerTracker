 MarkerTracker is an application developed to detect and track AR (Augmented Reality) markers from a real-time video stream, such as a webcam. It uses the NyARToolkit library for marker management and OpenCV for image processing. The system allows multiple AR markers to be tracked, allowing interaction with virtual objects based on the position and orientation of the detected markers
